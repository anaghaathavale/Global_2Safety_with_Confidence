# Installation
## Build dependencies
1. The build process uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.16 (or later). 

2. Depends on the Boost and the OpenBLAS libraries, which are automatically downloaded and built when you run make. Library CXXTEST comes included in the repository.

Instructions for Linux machines using CMake:
